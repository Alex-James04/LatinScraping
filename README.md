# Latin Texts Scraping

### Overview
- This project uses the Beautiful Soup Python library to scrape data from PHI Latin Texts (https://latin.packhum.org/browse). 
- The resulting parquet file in this repo contains ~1.8 million entries, with each row containing the total instances of a word per text per author, as well as a link to the text being referred to.
- The Power BI report linked below and included in the repo is a basic display of the scraped data, showing the number of times each word is used across the whole site, the total words by text, and the total words by author.

### Additional Information
- I attempted this project in order to gain familiarity with common web scraping tools, learn how to publish a basic Power BI report, and because it combines two of my vastly different areas of interest - computer/data science and Latin.
- If there are any concerns (i.e. the Power BI link doesn't work) or suggestions (i.e. ideas for more extensive analysis) for this project, please email me below.
